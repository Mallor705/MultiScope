## 1. Number of Instances

First, you need to decide how many instances of Steam you want to run. MultiScope supports up to 8 instances in total.

- **Splitscreen:** You can run a maximum of 4 instances per monitor.
- **Fullscreen:** You can run a maximum of 1 instance per monitor.

Use the "Number of Instances" spin row to set the desired number of instances.

## 2. Use Gamescope

The "Use Gamescope" option allows you to run each Steam instance in an isolated environment, which can improve performance and compatibility. It is recommended to keep this option enabled unless you have a specific reason to disable it.

## 3. Screen Mode

You can choose between two screen modes:

- **Fullscreen:** Each instance will run on a separate monitor.
- **Splitscreen:** Instances will be arranged on a single monitor, either horizontally or vertically.

### Splitscreen Options

When you select "Splitscreen," you can choose between two orientations:

- **Horizontal:** Instances are arranged side-by-side.
- **Vertical:** Instances are arranged one above the other.

## 4. Instance Configuration

For each instance, you can configure the following options:

- **Gamepad:** Assign a specific gamepad to the instance.
- **Grab Mouse and Keyboard:** Dedicate the mouse and keyboard to a single instance.
- **Audio Device:** Select a specific audio output device for the instance.
- **Refresh Rate:** Set the refresh rate for the instance. Util if you want to lock the FPS or use a specific refresh rate.

## 5. Starting an Instance

Once you have configured an instance, click the "Start" button next to it. This will launch a new, isolated instance of Steam. The first time you start an instance, Steam will need to be installed, which may take a few minutes.

You can start multiple instances by clicking the "Start" button for each one. To launch all selected instances at once, use the "Play" button at the bottom of the window.

## 6. Steam Big Picture Mode

For the best experience, it is recommended to enable "Big Picture Mode" in Steam's settings. This will provide a controller-friendly interface that is ideal for MultiScope.

To do this, go to `Settings > Interface` and check the box for "Start Steam in Big Picture Mode."

## 7. Play

Once all your instances are configured and running, you can start playing! Each instance will have its own dedicated input and audio devices, allowing you to play with your friends on the same computer.

Enjoy your gaming session!
